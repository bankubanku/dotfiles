# plasma config 
Although I prefer to focus on window tiling manager I want to keep [kde plasma](https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/) for some cases. This isn't greatly configurated, but I want to keep it as a base for future development.  

# instalation 
## prerequisites 
- KDE plasma 

## copying files 
Create a backup of your current config (or don't like I din't, although I do not recommend that)

Copy config files
```shell
cp -r dotfiles/plasma/* ~/.config/ 
```
