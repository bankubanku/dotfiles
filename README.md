# dotfiles
This repo is a chaotic collection of software that I configured (not everything is here yet). I created it to keep my config files in one place, so I can clone and use this on my new installed systems (yeah I'm doing resinstalls and distro hopping a lot), but I also share it to inspire people who want to create their own configuration. Although, remember that I configured this software for my personal needs. 

# installation 
Clone this repo in your home directory 
```shell
git clone https://github.com/bankubanku/dotfiles.git
```
Go to specific subdirectory to see more details about installation of specific config

# credits 
Thanks to [Victoria](https://github.com/holykremowka2137) for reviewing and helping me organize my dotfiles :3 

# contributions 
Well... since these config files are personalized, I don't accept any pull requests.

If you have any feedback or a problem, let me know via discord (b4nq) or create an issue
